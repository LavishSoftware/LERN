# LERN/LGUI2/1
This example, like most LGUI2 examples, consists of a controller object in LavishScript (in [1.iss](1.iss)) and a LavishGUI 2 package file ([1.json](1.json))

Run the script with ```run lern/lgui2/1```.

When this script runs, the LavishGUI 2 package file will be loaded via ```LGUI2:LoadPackage[filename]```, producing a window with the content "Hello World!"

This script will remain running until specifically ended, even if the window is closed by clicking its close button. End the script with ```end 1``` when finished; the full path is not required.

When the script is ended, the LavishGUI 2 package file will be unloaded via ```LGUI2:UnloadPackage[filename]```, and thereby removing the window that was loaded.

# LavishGUI 2 Packages
A LavishGUI 2 Package is a JSON object that can contain a list of UI elements, and other related data.

## Schema
A ```$schema``` property is specified in order to have validation, tooltips and auto-complete while editing the JSON.
```
    "$schema": "http://www.lavishsoft.com/schema/lgui2Package.json",
```

## Elements array
An ```elements``` array will specify each of the root-level GUI elements to create when this package is loaded.
```
    "elements": []
```

## Element definitions
In this example, we create a window with a small handful of properties.
```
{
    "$schema": "http://www.lavishsoft.com/schema/lgui2Package.json",
    "elements": [
        {
            "type":"window",
            "title":"LGUI2 Example 1",
            "name": "example1.window",
            "content":"Hello World!",
            "width":200,
            "height":60
        }
    ]
}
```

Most of these properties are optional, however ```type``` must always be provided, and for ```UnloadPackage``` to destroy the UI elements, a ```name``` must be provided.

This is still a valid UI element that can be unloaded via ```UnloadPackage```:
```        
{
    "type":"window",
    "name": "example1.window"
}
```

## Element definitions, as strings
It is also worth noting that LavishGUI 2 elements can also be represented by a string, instead of by a JSON Object. Here, ```content``` is actually accepting a UI element definition, which we have given as ```"Hello World!"```. Any element defined as a string instead of a JSON object will automatically be a ```textblock``` element, defined like so:
```
{
    "type":"textblock",
    "text":"Hello World!"
}
```

# Exercises
1. Change the ```content``` text, and run the example again

2. Change the ```content``` to a JSON object that defines a ```textblock```, instead of just a string

3. Did we mention that ```title``` is also a UI element? Change the ```title``` to a JSON object that defines a ```textblock```, instead of just a string

4. Create your own LavishGUI 2 Package .json file with a ```window```, and a .iss file to ```LoadPackage``` and ```UnloadPackage```
