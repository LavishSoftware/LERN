# LERN/JSON/2
This example continues exploring the LavishScript JSON API. Here we set a variable value dynamically.

Open the file [2.iss](2.iss), and run the script with ```run lern/json/2```.

## ```jsonvaluecontainer:SetValue```

In [LS/1](1.md) we covered initial values for a ```jsonvalue``` variable. To set the value at a later time, use the ```SetValue``` method and provide the desired value. The new value may be any type; it does not need to be the same type as the old value.

For example:
```
myjsonvalue:SetValue["\"Amazeballs!\""]
```

* Note: Not all ```jsonvalue```s can be modified. When creating a ```jsonvalue variable```, a ```jsonvaluecontainer``` is provided instead, which may be modified.

## Exercises

1. Run the script again, but pass any JSON value as a parameter
   * ```run lern/json/2 98.4```
   * ```run lern/json/2 65536```
   * ```run lern/json/2 null```
   * ```run lern/json/2 "\"The grey owl flies at midnight\""```
   * ```run lern/json/2 "{\"type\":\"cup\",\"emptiness\":0.5,\"fullness\":0.5}"```

2. Create your own .iss file with a ```function main``` and a ```variable jsonvalue```. Use the ```SetValue``` method to set it, then ```echo``` the value from the variable. Run it!
