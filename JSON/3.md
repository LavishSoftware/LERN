# LERN/JSON/3
This example continues exploring the LavishScript JSON API. Here we set a variable value dynamically, from a file.

Open the file [3.iss](3.iss), and run the script with ```run lern/json/3```.

## ```jsonvaluecontainer:ParseFile```

In [LS/2](2.md) we covered how to set the value at a later time with the ```SetValue``` method. This time, we'll read the value from a JSON-formatted file with ```ParseFile```.

For example:
```
myjsonvalue:ParseFile["example.json"]
```

Generally, it is recommended for JSON-formatted files to contain a JSON object, with ```{ }```. This allows for wide compatibility and uses.

## Exercises

1. Create your own .json file with your own values, and your own .iss file to load it with ```ParseFile```. 
   * Place the .json file in the same folder as the .iss file, and use a relative path to refer to the .json file
