# LERN/JSON/1
This example introduces LavishScript API for working with JSON values. While it will briefly introduce JSON concepts, it is recommended to visit [json.org](json.org) for the standard documentation!

Open the file [1.iss](1.iss), and run the script with ```run lern/json/1```.

## ```jsonvalue``` starter pack
This example shows the full range of JSON data types and values.

For each type, we create a ```variable jsonvalue``` and assign a value. 

A JSON parser will read and recognize the value as one of several types, depending on the value itself.

| Value Description | JSON Content Type | LavishScript Type |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----|
| Digits 0-9  | integer | ```int64``` |
| Digits 0-9 including a decimal  | number  | ```float64```
| Text enclosed by quotes ```" "```  | string  | ```string```
| ```true``` (literal) | ```true``` | ```bool``` |
| ```false``` (literal) | ```false``` | ```bool``` |
| ```null``` (literal) | ```null``` | NULL (no type) |
| ```[ ]``` | ```array``` | ```jsonarray``` |
| ```{ }``` | ```object``` | ```jsonobject``` |


* A JSON ```array``` may contain JSON values (including nested arrays), each separated by a comma, like this: ```[ 1, 2.0, "3", [ 4, 5.0 ] ]```
* A JSON ```object``` may contain named JSON values (or "properties") including nested objects and arrays, in the form ```"key":value``` and each separated by commas, like this:
 ```{ "name":"apple", "color":"red", "quantity":13, "keywords":["delicious", "poison"] }```

## ```jsonvalue.Type```
The ```jsonvalue``` object type provides a ```Type``` member which gives a string containing one of: ```integer```, ```number```, ```string```, ```true```, ```false```, ```object```, ```array```, or ```null```. This specifies the type of data contained by the ```jsonvalue```, and thus how its value can be interpreted.


## Exercises

1. Change the existing default values, and run the script again!

2. Create your own .iss file, and your own `variable jsonvalue` with a default value. Echo its JSON type via the ```jsonvalue.Type``` member, and also its value.
   * Remember to follow LavishScript syntax, and the JSON syntax (including any quotes required by JSON) go within the LavishScript syntax.
