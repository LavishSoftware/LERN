# LERN/LS/15
This example consists of a single file, [LS/15.iss](15.iss)

This example demonstrates the use of the ```if```-```elseif```-```else``` pattern.

Enter the command ```run lern/ls/15``` to run the example the first time. Then try ```run lern/ls/15 10``` or your own values!

## ```elseif``` statement
The ```elseif``` statement can be used to **chain** a separate condition and code block to a previous ```if``` or ```elseif```. 

If the first ```if``` statement is met, its conditional code is executed; **otherwise** it's skipped, and any ```elseif``` statements that immediately follow it will be checked.

Like this:
```
if ${value}<10
    echo ${value}. Warning: ${value} is less than 10
elseif ${value}>90
    echo ${value}. Warning: ${value} is greater than 90
```

* If the condition ```${value}<10``` was met, then the ```elseif``` is skipped entirely, without even checking its condition.
* If the condtion ```${value}<10``` is not met, then the condition ```${value}>90``` is checked. 

## ```else``` statement
The ```else``` statement can be used to **match all conditions not met by the current ```if```-```elseif``` chain**. 

An ```else``` statement therefore does not require its own ```condition``` to be specified.

It can be used like this:
```
if ${value}<10
    echo ${value}. Warning: ${value} is less than 10
else
    echo ${value}.
```

... or like this when chained with ```elseif```:
```
if ${value}<10
    echo ${value}. Warning: ${value} is less than 10
elseif ${value}>90
    echo ${value}. Warning: ${value} is greater than 90
else
    echo ${value}.
```


# Exercises
1. Create your own .iss file with a ```main``` function that accepts a ```string``` parameter. Use ```string.Length``` in an ```if```-```elseif```-```else``` chain to produce different ```echo``` commands depending on the length of the parameter!
