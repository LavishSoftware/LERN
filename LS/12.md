# LERN/LS/12
This example consists of a single file, [LS/12.iss](12.iss)

This example demonstrates specialized ```atom``` functions, and their use as commands.

Enter the command ```run lern/ls/12``` to run the example.

## Atomicity in LavishScript
When we refer to something as "atomic" in programming, it means that it is to be taken unbroken, as a whole. 

For LavishScript in particular, atomic functions **must complete immediately**, without possibly waiting for the host game (or application) to prepare another frame for rendering. In fact, atomic functions in LavishScript are considered to be "**blocking**", and will *prevent* the host game from advancing until finished.

Specialized ```function```s in LavishScript called ```member```s, ```method```s, and ```atom```s **are atomic**. 

The property of **being atomic** is what enables LavishScript to use these specialized functions for those specialized purposes. 

That is in contrast to a regular ```function```, which may persist for any length of time, as the game continues normally.

## Defining an ```atom```
An ```atom``` is defined exaclty like a ```function```, but with the ```atom``` keyword, like so:

```
atom tight()
{
    echo "Tight, bro"
}
```

## Using an ```atom``` as a command
The properties of an ```atom``` make them ideal for use *as commands* in LavishScript. 

The ```atom tight``` defined in this example can be executed as if it were a command called ```tight```, like this:
```
function main()
{
    tight
}
```

## The ```atexit``` atom
When a LavishScript script is ending, an atom called ```atexit``` is executed, if provided. 

This serves as an event handler, allowing the developer to destroy objects (such as GUI) and initiate other behaviors on behalf of the script before it completes shutting down.

# Exercises
1. Create your own command using an ```atom```. Try adding a parameter to the ```atom```, and pass a value to the command.
