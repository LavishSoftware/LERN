# LERN/LS/10
This example consists of a single file, [LS/10.iss](10.iss)

This example will create three ```fruit```s, and this time each will be created with its own value.

Enter the command ```run lern/ls/10``` to run the example.

## The ```Initialize``` method
LavishScript will attempt to execute an ```Initialize``` method when an ```objectdef``` is being *instantiated*, such as creating a ```variable```. An ```Initialize``` method is not required, as can be inferred by its omission from prior examples.

The ```Initialize``` method essentially serves two purpose:
1. **It serves as a sort of event handler**, for when any object of this type is being created. This may assign initial values to its variables, initiate other behaviors on behalf of the object, and so on.
2. **It accepts the defined value** (if any), for example when a ```variable``` is created and using the ```=``` syntax.

The ```Initialize``` method **can** accept parameters, but is *not required to*.

## The ```Shutdown``` method
LavishScript will attempt to execute a ```Shutdown``` method when an instance of that ```objectdef```, such as a ```variable```, is being destroyed.

**No values are ever provided** to the ```Shutdown``` method; it is purely to serve as a sort of event handler. It may destroy other objects (such as any GUI that might represent the object) or initiate other behaviors on its behalf, and so on.

## Accessing ```member```s and ```method```s from the same objectdef
**LavishScript provides a reference to the current object** -- that is, the one the ```member``` or ```method``` is executing with/on -- **called ```This```**. 

That is important partly because, *unlike* a ```variable```, **a ```member``` or a ```method``` can only be accessed *through* some object**. A ```variable``` *can* be accessed through some object, though specifying the object is not *required*.

**```member```s and ```method```s must be used as part of a sequence**, and that sequence must start with the name of some object. In ```${FruitB:SetName["Banana"]}```, the name of that object is ```FruitB```.

So for example, the ```method``` called ```SetName``` can be executed from within ```main``` via:
```
FruitB:SetName["Banana"]
```

... however, the name ```FruitB``` is restricted to usage within the ```main``` function, because it is a *local* ```variable```, to ```main```. Accessing ```${FruitB}``` within one of the ```fruit``` members or methods will have **no object** and will thus produce **NULL**.

Furthermore, we have 3 different ```fruit``` objects in our example, so ```Initialize``` should definitely not specifically use ```FruitB```. It should be using whichever object the ```Initialize``` method is meant to be executing with/on, like this:
```
This:SetName["Banana"]
```

# Exercises
1. Add a "D" fruit!

2. Create your own ```objectdef``` with an ```Initialize``` method, and even a ```Shutdown``` method if you like, and create a ```variable```!
