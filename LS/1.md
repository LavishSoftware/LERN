# LERN/LS/1
This example consists of a single file, [LS/1.iss](1.iss)

Enter the command ```run lern/ls/1``` to run the example.

This is your standard "Hello World!" example. It will use the ```echo``` command to print ```Hello World!``` into the console.

## The main function
The "main" ```function```, which specifies what the script does when it is run, is introduced in its most basic form:
```
function main()
{

}
```

## The echo command
The command is then placed within the code block denoted by ```{``` and ```}```, which **must each be on their own line**.

```
echo "Hello World!"
```

## Single-line Comments
Single-line comments in LavishScript are specified by beginning the line (after any whitespace) with ```;```, such as:

```
; This is a standard "Hello World!" example
```

**The next examples will provide additional details and introduce more concepts.**

# Suggested exercises
* Replace "Hello World!" with your own text, and run the script again.
* Create your own .iss file with a main function, and your own echo command(s). Run it!
