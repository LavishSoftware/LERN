# LERN/LS/4
This example consists of a single file, [LS/4.iss](4.iss)

Much like [LS/3.iss](3.iss), this example will produce output depending on a parameter that you supply to the script, after the filename given to the RunScript command.

Enter the command ```run lern/ls/4 "Hello " World"``` (including the quotes) to run the example.
* Is the output what you predicted?

## Escaping Text
Certain text characters, such as ```"``` have special meaning in LavishScript. The ```"``` is used to split parameters for commands. This means that parameters that are meant to contain a ```"``` must use special syntax to indicate that it is **not** meant to split the parameter. Doing so is called "escaping" the character.

LavishScript follows the standard practice of escaping quotes and other special characters with ```\```, for example ```"I'll \"LERN\" something today!"``` would produce a single parameter that contains quotes around LERN.

## Escaping in Data Sequences
Or, ***"Naughty Data Sequences need love too."***

The contents of a Data Sequence can be escaped by using a ```~``` (tilde) character within the ```${ }```, like this: ```${Phrase~}```.

## Best Practice for Escaping
* ```string``` parameters should always be escaped and quoted!
* When passing a Data Sequence that ends with a ```string``` -- or may otherwise result in text with quotes or special characters -- use ```~``` inside the end of the ```${ }```, like this: ```${ ~}```

# Exercises
1. This example started with a poorly formed command, which produced undesired output. Try the command again, but this time **escape the lonely ```"```** in the middle of ```"Hello " World"``` with a ```\```.
   * Now is the output what you predicted?

2. Create your own .iss file that takes a string parameter, uses ```echo``` to print the value, and follows **Best Practice for Escaping** by quoting with ```"``` and escaping with ```~```. Run it!
