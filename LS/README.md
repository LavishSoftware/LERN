# LERN/LS

This series provides your **Introduction to Programming in LavishScript**!

Each example in this series provides a code (.iss) file, and a markdown (.md) file. 

**Click the link below to view the formatted markdown file, then open the specified .iss file side-by-side**. That way, you are free to quickly refer to the code as you read the detailed explanation, and vice versa!

* You can **split the view** to see Intro/1.iss and Intro/1.md side-by-side with the hotkey **Ctrl+\\**, or by clicking the "Split Editor Right" button at the top right corner of the Visual Studio Code window.
