## Object ```member```s
Generally speaking, in Object-Oriented Programming a "member" of an object is a ```variable``` (nested, as we have already seen) or "property" belonging to that object.

LavishScript provides a way for a specialized ```function``` to provide the desired value for a Data Sequence, in place of a ```variable```. 

The ```member``` keyword is used to define such a specialized function, which in all other ways is defined exactly like a ```function```:
```
member ToText()
{
    return "${Name} ${Color}"
}
```

## The ```ToText``` member
When LavishScript wants to get "the value of an object" via a Data Sequence, such as ```${WhatFruit}```, it does so by attempting to access a ```member``` specifically called ```ToText```. If provided, the ```return``` value from ```ToText``` is used.

Here, we echo the value of ```WhatFruit```, which in turn accesses our ```ToText``` member:
```
echo WhatFruit: ${WhatFruit}
```

## Getting the ```Length``` of a ```string```
Built-in types like ```string``` have ```member```s too! While not defined by an ```objectdef``` that you can view, they are used the same way. 

To get the length of a ```string```, a ```Length``` member is provided, which can be accessed like so:

```
    echo ${WhatFruit.Name.Length}
```

Here, we first access the ```Name``` variable that is nested inside ```WhatFruit```. Because ```WhatFruit.Name``` is a string, we can then access the ```Length``` Member via ```WhatFruit.Name.Length```.

# Exercises
1. Change the ```Name``` and ```Color``` values to something other than ```Apple``` and ```Red```, then run the script again!

2. Try adding an echo that uses a ```~``` (tilde) to get the ```Length``` of ```${WhatFruit}```, like ```${WhatFruit~.Length}```, and run the script again
   * NOTE: Exercise 2 is affected by a LavishScript bug, resolved in dxLavish/Inner Space build 6669.

3. Add additional text to the ```return``` value in ```ToText```, and run the script again
