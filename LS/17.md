# LERN/LS/17
This example consists of a single file, [LS/17.iss](17.iss)

This example demonstrates the use of a ```for``` loop to repeat some code **while a condition is met**. In this example, we output numbers from 1 to 10.

Enter the command ```run lern/ls/17``` to run the example. 

## The ```for``` statement
The ```for``` statement offers a relatively compact way to combine 3 separate clauses into one line:
1. A ```command to start the loop``` (such as to set a loop counter to its initial value)
2. The ```condition```, which is checked at the top
3. A ```command to advance to the next iteration``` (such as to ```Inc``` a loop counter)

As with other loops and conditional code, ```for``` is followed by either a single line of code, or a code block.

A ```for``` loop therefore looks like this:
```
for (command to start the loop ; condition ; command to advance to the next iteration)
{

}
```

## ```int:Set```
Most of the "basic types" in LavishScript have a ```Set``` method, which is used to assign a new value to the object. ```int``` is one of these "basic types".

For numeric types in particular, including ```int```, ```uint```, and others, the ```Set``` method speficially accepts ```math```.

In our example, we use a counter ```variable``` called ```Count```, and we set it to 1 like so:
```
Count:Set[1]
```

Because ```int:Set``` accepts math, we could place calculations inside as well, such as ```Count:Set[1+2]```, and so on.

## Our ```for``` loop
In our example, the 3 clauses are as follows:
1. ```Count:Set[1]```
2. ```${Count}<=10```
3. ```Count:Inc```

As explained above, these are placed together to form the ```for``` statement, like so:
```
    for ( Count:Set[1] ; ${Count}<=10 ; Count:Inc )
```

This time, the code block itself only contains a single line:
```
echo ${Count}
```
... because the ```command to advance to the next iteration```, which is inside the code block in a ```while``` or ```do```-```while``` loop, is now placed within the loop statement itself.
