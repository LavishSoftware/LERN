# LERN/LS/17
This example consists of a single file, [LS/17.iss](17.iss)

This example demonstrates the use of ```do```-```while``` to repeat some code **while a condition is met**, with the condition check *after* the code. In this example, we output numbers from 1 to 10.

Enter the command ```run lern/ls/17``` to run the example. 

## The ```do```-```while``` pattern
The ```do``` keyword indicates that a code block or line of code, and a ```while``` statement will follow, like this:

```
do
{

}
while condition
```

Here, the condition is **not checked until the ```while``` statement is reached**, so the behavior and general purpose of a ```do```-```while``` loop is to **always execute the loop at least one time**. 

In fact, it is possible that the ```while``` statement itself is never reached, and therefore the condition never checked.

## The ```break``` statement
To exit out of a loop, use ```break```, like this:

```
do
{
    echo This line executes one time, despite being in a loop!

    break
}
while TRUE
```

Generally, a ```break``` is used *conditionally*; for example within an ```if``` inside the loop.

Code execution will continue after the loop.


## The ```continue``` statement
To skip the rest of the loop and **advance to the next ```condition``` check**, use ```continue```, like this:

```
while ${Count}<=10
{
    Count:Inc
    if ${Count}%2
        continue

    echo ${Count}%2 must equal 0
}
```

As with ```break```, a ```continue``` is generally used conditionally.

# Exercises
1. Create your own .iss file with a ```main``` function and a ```do```-```while``` loop to count from 2 to 30, by 2
