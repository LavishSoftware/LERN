# LERN/LS/5
This example consists of a single file, [LS/5.iss](5.iss)

Enter the command ```run lern/ls/5``` to run the example.

## The ```return``` command
The ```return``` command has two purposes. 
1. It **immediately exits** out of the current ```function``` (or equivalents that you'll learn of later). 
2. It can **provide a value** to its caller

The ```return``` command can be used with or without parameters, like so:

```
return
return "Hello World!"
```

## The ```Return``` object
After using a ```call``` command to call a ```function```, the caller can access a ```Return``` object that contains the value (if any) that was "returned" by the called ```function```. 

Like so:
```    
call GetTheAnswer
echo ${Return}
```

The value will be available unless/until the caller uses another ```call``` command, which would then replace it.

# Exercises
1. Replace the ```return``` value with your own made-up value, and run the script again!

2. Replace the ```return``` value with **quoted text that contains quotes**, and run the script again!
   * Can you identify any other line(s) in the code you should now change?
