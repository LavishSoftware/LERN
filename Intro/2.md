# LERN/Intro/2
Enter the command ```run lern/intro/2 "Hello World"``` (use the quotes) to run the example.

Scripts can take parameters if needed. 
In this example, the main function takes a parameter.
That parameter is a string, and that string contains "Hello World". 

That parameter can then be used just like a variable within that function:
```
echo param1 = ${param1}
```
The ```${param1}``` is showing what is being held within that variable.

# Suggested exercise
- Write your own script that will have a main function that takes a parameter.
  - remember to list the variable type first, then the variable name. example: ```string param1```
  - Run it with the parameter added in during the ```run <scriptname> <parameter>```.
