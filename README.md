# LERN
We're here to LERN! Lavish Example Repository ... node ...  provides examples and resources for learning LavishScript, and LavishGUI 2 and friends

LERN is a work-in-progress, originally created with supplemental materials to teach a small group. We are now providing these examples, and we will work on filling in additional or missing details for you to learn from.

LERN covers a range of topics, from beginner level to advanced. 

# Requirements
* Using LERN will require you to have Inner Space (not free) or dxLavish (basically a free, lightweight/stripped-down Inner Space instance). LERN is designed with dxLavish in mind.
* Some examples are affected by known bugs that are fixed in updated builds of Inner Space or dxLavish
* Visual Studio Code is our recommended editor, for LavishScript highlighting in particular. A LavishScript add-on for VS Code is available from the Marketplace, and should automatically provide a notification to download it the first time you open a LavishScript .iss file with Visual Studio Code.

# Getting Started
* Place the LERN folder in your dxLavish folder, or under Inner Space/Scripts.
* Open the LERN folder with Visual Studio Code, and open to Intro/1.iss
* Run LERN/Intro/1.iss in dxLavish or Inner Space via the Console with the command "run lern/intro/1"
* Continue upward in number through the Intro folder to gain a little understanding of LavishScript.

After completing the Intro folder it is recommended to move on specifically to LGUI2/1.iss:
* Open LGUI2/1.iss in Visual Studio Code
* Run LERN/LGUI2/1.iss in dxLavish or Inner Space via the Console with the command "run lern/lgui2/1"
* For scripts that do not end on their own, the EndScript command can be used to end the script, e.g. "end 1" to end LERN/lgui2/1 (full path not required)

The LavishGUI 2 examples are broken into many separate series, covering different types of UI controls and concepts.

# Topics
Different subject are generally divided into main folders
* Intro: Introduction to LavishScript
* LGUI2: Covers many aspects of LavishGUI 2
* JSON: Read and Write JSON in LavishScript
* Lists: Manage lists of things in LavishScript, including conversion to and from JSON
* LMAC: LavishMachine, a Virtual Machine system that currently manages "Tasks" for LavishScript
* Game: Introduction to game development with LavishGUI 2!
* Audio: Use the Audio engine to play sounds

# Tinker!
The examples are meant for you to learn from, and even try out your own changes. Just edit, save, and run!
