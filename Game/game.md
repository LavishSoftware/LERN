# LGUI2/Game/game

This example is a template for a game controller and a LGUI2 Window, which can be copied to create your own basic game controller. It consists of [game.iss](game.iss) and [game.json](game.json).

This template is used as-is for **Game/1**; see [Game/1.md](1.md) for more information on the basic Game Controller template.
